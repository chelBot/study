                In response to the wayfinding pains identified in our first <a target="_blank" href="https://chelbot.github.io/user-pains/">contextual inquiry</a>, two alternative content delivery methods were explored. The key results for the proposed design solution are to reduce the number of: 
                <ul>
                    <li>clicks required to access a single piece of content.</li>
                    <li>tabs/windows opened while navigating through content.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Six Resmedians with product or people functions were interviewed. For more expert feedback, we included two UX/UI designers in the study. Interviewees were asked to view content delivered in three distinct modalities:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cornerstone Playlists (the current offering)</li>
                        <li>Cornerstone Curriculum</li>
                        <li>Cornerstone Online Class (an xAPI wrapped RISE page)</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most participants voiced an affective preference for the online class modality which was authored in RISE. The content for this experience was slightly modified to better adhere to instructional and UX design best practice. All participants demonstrated stronger wayfinding acumen in this experience.

            <h2>Cohesion</h2>
            <p>Compared to the more modular playlist and curriculum modalities, the class or RISE modality was considered cohesive and cognitively kind. While users often complain about losing focus while navigating through playlist windows/tabs, the RISE experience brings all the content into a single interface, creating a more immersive and engaging experience.</p>

            <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
            <p>"Playlists" are often associated with video or music content. The RISE experience was often discribed as magazine or book like.</p>

            <p>The candidate who affectively preferred the playlist modality was unable to successfully navigate back to content.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Based on behavioral observations and stated preference, the online class or RISE experience is easier to navigate. Most users (5 of 6) said that this is the experience they prefer.</p>

            <p>Note: The above user found the RISE experience easier to navigate and rated it as the better experience overall. Still, she encouraged us to stick with playlists. Sunk cost fallacy?</p>
